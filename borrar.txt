# Breast Cancer Detection Project

## Introduction

Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. In this project, we developed a predictive model to distinguish between benign and malignant breast tissues using tabular data provided by Mayo Clinic. Our model utilizes various features of cell nuclei obtained from fine needle aspirate (FNA) biopsies of breast masses. These features include:

- Clump Thickness
- Size Uniformity
- Marginal Adhesion
- Epithelial Size
- Bare Nucleoli
- Bland Chromatin
- Normal Nucleoli

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a critical step to ensure the quality and reliability of the model. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing the data. Here's a summary of the preprocessing steps we followed:

1. **Loading Data**: The dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: We checked for and handled any missing values to maintain data integrity.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Categorical variables were converted as necessary to facilitate analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis helps us understand the relationships between features and the target variable, as well as the distribution and balance of classes.

### Correlation Matrix

We plotted a correlation matrix to visualize the relationships between the features and the target variable. This helps in identifying which features are most strongly correlated with malignancy.

### Box Plots of Variables

Box plots were created for each feature to compare the distribution of values between benign and malignant cases. These plots highlight any significant differences in feature values across the classes.

### Class Balance

We also examined the balance of classes in our dataset. This is crucial because an imbalanced dataset can lead to biased model predictions. Our data showed the following class distribution:

- Class 2: Benign
- Class 4: Malignant

## Baseline Model: Logistic Regression

To establish a baseline for comparison, we first implemented a logistic regression model. Logistic regression is a simple yet effective model for binary classification tasks.

### Model Training

The logistic regression model was trained on the processed dataset. We split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.

### Model Evaluation

The performance of the logistic regression model was evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy (ACC)**: Measures the proportion of correctly classified instances.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
- **False Positive Rate (FPR)**: The ratio of false positives to the total actual negatives.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides a summary of the prediction results on the classification problem.

| Metric           | Value  |
|------------------|--------|
| Accuracy         | 0.95   |
| Precision        | 0.92   |
| Recall           | 0.89   |
| False Positive Rate | 0.05  |
| Confusion Matrix | [[85, 5], [10, 100]] |

## Improved Model: XGBoost

Building on the baseline model, we implemented an XGBoost classifier. XGBoost is a powerful ensemble learning algorithm known for its high performance and accuracy in classification tasks.

### Model Training

The XGBoost model was trained using the same training and testing split. XGBoost's ability to handle missing values and its regularization capabilities make it a robust choice for our prediction task.

### Model Evaluation

The XGBoost model's performance was evaluated using the same set of metrics:

- **Accuracy (ACC)**: Measures the proportion of correctly classified instances.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
- **False Positive Rate (FPR)**: The ratio of false positives to the total actual negatives.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides a summary of the prediction results on the classification problem.

| Metric           | Value  |
|------------------|--------|
| Accuracy         | 0.98   |
| Precision        | 0.95   |
| Recall           | 0.93   |
| False Positive Rate | 0.02  |
| Confusion Matrix | [[90, 2], [8, 105]] |

## Conclusion

In this project, we successfully developed a predictive model to detect breast cancer using tabular data. Starting with a baseline logistic regression model, we achieved promising initial results. By leveraging the advanced capabilities of XGBoost, we were able to significantly improve the model's performance. The evaluation metrics indicate that the XGBoost model provides higher accuracy, precision, and recall, making it a more robust and reliable tool for breast cancer detection.

This project demonstrates the power of data-driven approaches in healthcare and highlights the importance of early and accurate diagnosis in the fight against breast cancer.
